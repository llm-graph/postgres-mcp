You have to follow these rules:
## Do:

2. Use functional programming techniques exclusively
3. Maintain immutability throughout
4. Ensure all changes pass `bun test`
5. Write isolated test cases using bun:test without mocks
6. Use DRY principle across all files
7. Always have bun-first mindset

## Don't:
8. Avoid OOP, classes, or inheritance
9. Avoid traditional methods (use higher order functions instead)
10. Don't write comments
11. Don't use `any` or `unknown` types
12. Do not create code of simulation, stub, mock, etc. you should produce code of real expected features
13. Should not create another files other than these:
   - `src/constants.ts` configuration defaults
   - `src/core.ts` - Core functionality
   - `src/types.ts` - Type definitions
   - `src/utils.ts` - Utility functions
   - `test/e2e/* & test/unit/*` - Test files
