1. while addressing fail tests, always have a mindset that there must be main program core error to fix rather than make test less strict!!
2. Test cases should be isolated and clean no left over even on sigterm
3. Implement e2e tests for all features with real implementation
4. Create challenging, thorough test cases that fully verify implementation
5. Test cases should match expected [README.md](mdc:README.md) requirements
6. Do not create test of tricks, simulation, stub, mock, etc. you should produce code of real algorithm
7. Do not create any new file for helper,script etc. just do what prompted.
